# POE2Bot
So this is a bot that does a few cool things related to poe2

### POE2 Commands:
- trade - issue trade query to poe2 trade site API, displays first 10 results in a paginated embed
- currency - using poe2scout API's collected data you can display current market prices for basic currency

### Other Commands:
- rtd - roll the dice -> get result from 1 to 6
- coinflip - flip a coin -> get tails or head
- gibcat - issue a CATAPI query and get a random picture of a cat

### What's coming ?
- I want to improve currency command or create another one that will let you specify which items you want to convert (for example how many chaos does div cost)
- I want to make trade command more 'user friendly' for now it is just a proof of concept
